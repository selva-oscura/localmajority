            <h2>LOCAL MAJORITY IS A NEW POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE</h2>
            <p>
              With the federal government firmly in the hands of the right
              wing, the front line in the battle to advance Democratic
              priorities in America has shifted to key state capitols.<br />Progressive
              victories in 2018 and beyond will depend on the immediate
              implementation of robust state-level efforts combining
              grass-roots activism with strategic investments in
              high-potential candidates and races.
            </p>
            <p>
              The right wing is already there. Local Majority plans to fight
              fire with fire.

          <h2 className="col-12">RED AND PURPLE STATES MATTER</h2>
          <p className="col-12">
            In some ways, the outcome of the November 2016 election may have
            been inevitable. Focused on national policy over the past several
            decades, progressives—who tend to be concentrated in a handful of
            politically friendly regions in coastal states—largely ceded power
            in many states to the right wing as it took up residence under the
            Republican banner.
          </p>
          <p className="col-12">
            The result is that 25 American states are now governed by a
            Republican majority or supermajority in which the right wing
            controls the governorship and both houses of the state
            legislature, sometimes with a two-thirds majority that allows for
            implementation of an extremist agenda with near impunity. In a
            number of cases, this ideology also extends to the state supreme
            court.
          </p>
          <p className="col-12">
            This is increasingly becoming a human rights issue. Having lost
            their protection in Washington, our brothers and sisters in
            Republican-controlled states who seek basic human rights such as
            equal protection under the law, affordable health care,
            environmental justice, and the right to control their own
            reproduction are today more vulnerable than ever. These basic
            rights are under attack right now in fully one-half of our
            country. And the trend is not moving in the favor of liberty.
            Voter suppression is on the rise. We need to act now to stop this
            erosion of liberty affecting millions of Americans.

          <h2 className="col-12">AS GO THE STATES, SO GOES THE NATION</h2>
          <p className="col-12">
            How can state assembly races in far-flung districts affect the
            entire nation? In a word: gerrymandering. Every ten years the
            publication of the federal census triggers a redrawing of the
            district boundaries governing a population’s representation in the
            state government and the U.S. Congress. A majority in the state
            legislature can further strengthen its position by allowing
            partisans to control this process. Thus the 25 Republican
            majorities in statehouses across America have everything to do
            with the makeup of the U.S. Congress and, by extension, the
            Supreme Court.
          </p>
          <p className="col-12">
            The bad news is that for a decade or more the deck has been
            stacked in many conservative states, thanks to the
            disproportionate influence of state legislators over district
            boundaries. The good news is that a slow but steady demographic
            shift in key states is creating new opportunities to effect
            significant change. Strategic efforts to win back even a handful
            of seats in targeted state capitols will have an especially
            positive impact on future elections.
          </p>
          <p className="col-12">
            Census data will next be released in 2020 and leaders in every
            state will seek to control the makeup of districts for the 2022
            elections. We are playing the long game. What we do — or don’t do
            — in 2017 will be directly felt in 2022.

            NOT JUST ANOTHER POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE
          </h2>
          <p className="col-12">
            Progressive Americans who would like to see change in 2020 have
            not just an opportunity but an imperative to act now. Virginia,
            North Carolina, and a handful of other swing states are emerging
            as critical battlegrounds in 2017, 2018, and beyond, and the usual
            suspects are already directing money and attention that way. The
            ultra-conservative political fundraising network associated with
            the Koch brothers expects to direct $300-$400 million toward this
            fight in the next two years alone.

            Local Majority brings the best of all worlds to this fight. Its
            principals are veteran Democratic operatives who have close ties
            to key individuals and organizations at the forefront of the
            progressive movement but are not subject to their constraints.
          </p>
          <p className="col-12">
            Institutions such as Planned Parenthood, the American Civil
            Liberties Union, and the Democratic National Committee are doing
            important work, but much of it is being carried out in silos.
          </p>
          <p className="col-12">
            Local Majority is uniquely positioned to identify and fill the
            gaps between these silos in a way that complements and does not
            compete with their efforts. As a political action committee, it is
            to the established progressive institutions as special operations
            are to the armed forces. Nimble and pragmatic, Local Majority can
            deploy assets strategically to enhance the entire effort.

            Hard-won environmental and civil rights protections, the makeup of
            the United States Supreme Court, indeed the very heart and soul of
            our nation—this is what is at stake. But the fight will only be
            won by diving deep into local contests, district by district and
            state by state.

          <p className="col-12">
            At this very moment, the torch is being carried by hard-working
            activists working tirelessly to elect candidates we have never
            heard of but on whom our aspirations in 2020 and beyond may
            depend. Their opposition is already flush with right-wing money.
